### Seamless integration of 3D medical images into Markdown

Welcome to **DICOMPress**, a toolkit designed for professionals in healthcare, education, and research who want to create web-based protocols with embedded, interactive 3D medical images (CT/MRI). Whether for clinical studies, educational material, or research documentation, **DICOMPress** combines the power of **VitePress** and **Niivue**.

This project builds upon:
- **[VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress)**: A Vite-powered static site generator with markdown support and Vue components integration.
- **[Niivue](https://github.com/niivue/niivue)**: A high-performance, WebGL-based DICOM viewer for rendering 3D medical images (CT/MRI) with advanced features like segmentation overlays.
